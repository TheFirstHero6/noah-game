# War of the Elector: Master Rulebook

This document contains the complete rules for **War of the Elector** based on the **Imperium Fragmentum (2nd Edition)** ruleset, which is the current implementation of the game.

## 1. Sequence of the Turn

Each turn follows a specific sequence of phases:

1. **Collect Income** - Cities generate income based on their tier level
2. **Pay upkeep and move armies** - Army upkeep must be paid at the start of the turn
3. **Receive event** - An event available to all players will trigger
4. **Build and recruitment** - Players can build buildings and recruit units
5. **Give movement orders** - Players give movement orders for the next turn

### Turn Phase Details

#### 1. Collect Income

- Income is based on city tier level (Local Trade)
- Each city generates income per turn based on its upgrade tier:
  - Tier 1: 10 Currency
  - Tier 2: 15 Currency
  - Tier 3: 40 Currency
  - Tier 4: 55 Currency
  - Tier 5: 70 Currency
- This income is added to the city's local wealth
- Players can set a tax rate (percentage) to take a portion of the city's wealth as Currency
- Costs for buildings and units are paid from the player's wealth (Currency and resources), not the city's wealth

#### 2. Pay Upkeep and Move Armies

- Army upkeep must be paid at the start of the turn
- Each unit requires 2 Food per turn for upkeep
- If upkeep is not paid in full, armies will mutiny
- Armies move at the same time to avoid conflict

#### 3. Receive Event

- An event available to all players will trigger, providing opportunities for intrigue

#### 4. Build and Recruitment

- Buildings and units have costs in resources and Currency
- These costs are paid from the player's wealth, not the cities' wealth
- Building production happens each turn based on the building's tier

#### 5. Give Movement Orders

- At the end of the turn, if a player will move an army next turn, they give movement orders
- Movement orders are processed simultaneously

- **Wood** - Used for building construction and unit recruitment
- **Stone** - Used for building construction and unit recruitment

### City Tiers

Cities can be upgraded through 5 tiers:

| Tier | Income (per turn) | Upgrade Cost (Currency, Wood, Stone) |

Cities are acquired in three ways:

1. **Won in battle** - Cities can be captured through military conquest
2. **Transferred by admin** - Realm admins can transfer cities between players
3. **Gifted by admin** - Realm admins can gift cities to players

**Important:** Players cannot build or create new cities - they must acquire them through one of these methods.

### Unit Cap (Population)

**Important:** "Population" in this game refers only to the unit cap for recruiting armies in a city, not general population.

The maximum number of units you can recruit is based on the total tier of all cities you control:

| City Tier | Maximum Units |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| Tier 1    | 2 units        |
| Tier 2    | 3 units        |
| Tier 3    | 7 units        |
| Tier 4    | 10 units       |
| Tier 5    | 15 units       |

**Example:** If you control one Tier 3 city and one Tier 2 city, your total unit cap is 7 + 3 = 10 units.

## 6. Realms

### What are Realms?

Realms are separate game instances - each realm has its own players, cities, armies, and resources. Players can belong to multiple realms, but must select which realm they're currently playing in.

### Realm Roles

There are three realm-scoped roles:

- **BASIC** - User can play normally, no admin functions
- **ADMIN** - User can manage resources of other players in the realm, pass turns, transfer cities/armies
- **OWNER** - Can do everything an ADMIN can, plus kick people from the realm

### Creating a Realm

To create a new realm:

1. Navigate to the Realms page
2. Click the "Create Realm" button (with a ➕ icon)
3. Enter a name for the realm in the modal that appears
4. Click "Create" to finalize

When a realm is created:

- The creator automatically becomes the **OWNER** of the realm
- A unique join code is automatically generated for the realm (6 characters, uppercase)
- Initial resources (Currency, Food, Wood, Stone, Metal, Livestock) are set to 0 for the owner
- Other players can join the realm using the join code

### Joining a Realm

To join an existing realm:

1. Navigate to the Realms page
2. Click the "Join Realm" button
3. Enter the 6-character join code (automatically converted to uppercase)
4. Click "Join" to finalize

When a player joins a realm:

- They automatically receive the **BASIC** role in that realm
- Initial resources (Currency, Food, Wood, Stone, Metal, Livestock) are set to 0
- They are automatically switched to the joined realm
- If the join code is invalid, they will receive an error message
- If they are already a member of the realm, they will receive an error message

**Note:** Join codes are case-insensitive (automatically converted to uppercase). The join code can be found on the Realms page for each realm (visible to ADMIN and OWNER roles).

### Realm Management

- Players can switch between realms they belong to from the Realms page
- Each realm operates independently with its own turn progression
- Resources, cities, and armies are realm-specific

---

## 7. Important Game Mechanics

### Cost Payment

- All costs (buildings, units, city upgrades) are paid from the **player's wealth** (Currency and resources), not the city's wealth
- Players must have sufficient resources in their personal inventory to make purchases

### Income Collection

- Income is collected automatically at the start of each turn
- City income is based on the city's tier level
- Players can set tax rates to extract Currency from their cities

### Building Production

- Building production happens each turn based on the building's tier
- Production is added directly to the player's resource inventory
- Production rates increase with building tier upgrades

### Army Upkeep

- Upkeep must be paid at the start of the turn or armies will mutiny
- Each unit requires 2 Food per turn
- Upkeep is automatically deducted from the player's Food resources

### Turn Advancement

- Turns are advanced by realm admins or owners
- When a turn is advanced, all players in the realm:
  - Collect income from their cities
  - Generate resources from their buildings
  - Pay upkeep for their units
  - Receive events (if applicable)

---

## 8. Strategy Tips

1. **Focus on resource production early** - Build Fields, Sawmills, Quarries, and Mines to generate resources
2. **Upgrade cities for income** - Higher tier cities generate significantly more Currency
3. **Balance building types** - You can only have 4 buildings per city, so choose wisely
4. **Manage unit upkeep** - Make sure you have enough Food production to support your armies
5. **Plan your unit cap** - Higher tier cities allow more units, so upgrade strategically
6. **Use tax rates wisely** - Extract Currency from cities without depleting their wealth completely

## Appendix: Legacy Rules

The original "War of the Elector" ruleset included additional mechanics such as:
- The Electorate voting system
- Family and character mechanics
- Retinue system (counselors, spies, bodyguards)
- Marriage mechanics
- More complex building types

These mechanics may be added in future updates. The current implementation focuses on the core economic and military gameplay from the Imperium Fragmentum (2nd Edition) ruleset.
