## 1. The Electorate: Politics & Voting

### How it Works

The Electorate is a province within the Holy Roman Empire. Like the Empire, lord within the Electorate has a vote on matters within its borders.

### Voting Power

- Each Lord or Lady (player) gets a percentage of the vote based on the num towns they control within the Electorate.
- 1 town = 5% of the vote.
- These votes are used to pass laws.
- There is an executive position, the "Lord Elector".
- The Lord Elector is elected by a majority vote based on the percentage of g power, excluding any unclaimed voting power.

### The Lord Elector

- The position of Lord Elector is granted to one player's character followi ajority vote.
- Under current law, this character remains the Lord Elector until death.
- The player controlling the Lord Elector faces dilemmas and makes decision the entire electorate.
- Because of this, the Lord Elector (under current law) has the power to re troops and taxes from the other lords.
- These are only the starting rules. Players can vote to grant more power t take power away from, the Lord Elector.

### Current Voting Power

| Player/Status | Voting Power |
| :------------ | :----------- |
| Eli           | 5.0%         |
| Unclaimed     | 55.0%        |
| Ben           | 5.0%         |
| Katie         | 5.0%         |
| Silas         | 5.0%         |
| Aidan         | 5.0%         |
| Tanner        | 5.0%         |
| Luke          | 5.0%         |
| Klaus         | 5.0%         |
| Nate          | 5.0%         |

## 2. Family & Characters

### How it Works

Family members are a key part of the game and are essential for gaining an ver opponents.

### Character Actions

Characters aged 18 or older can perform the following actions:

- Lead Armies
- Govern Regions
- Complete Missions

### Family Growth

- Players lose the game if they have no family members remaining.
- Families grow in two ways: adopting a patron into the family (a common pr ) or by having children.
- Once every year (4 seasons), if you have a married couple in your family 0-55, you roll a d20.
  - **1-10:** Nothing happens.
  - **11-18:** They have one child. You may add a portrait to the family t age one.
  - **19:** They have two children.
  - **20:** They have three children.

### Marriages

- Noble houses only permit their members to marry people of noble rank.
- There are two ways to get a spouse for a character:
  1.  **Search minor noble houses:** Pay $1000 in dowry to receive a spou
  2.  **Marry another player's character:** One player receives a charact d the other player loses one. This is done in exchange for a suitable dowry and, often, an alliance.

## 3. Retinue

### Overview

Characters will develop and gain traits and retinue over time. There are th pes of retinue that can be acquired. Retinue stays with a character until they are reassigned or the character dies.

### Acquisition

Retinue can be acquired in two ways:

1.  By completing missions.
2.  They may pass through the province and offer their services for a price

### Retinue Types

- **Counselors**
  - These retinue have traits that make your character more effective at ing a region or leading armies.
  - The counselor has set traits and a salary that must be paid to keep t
- **Spies**
  - Spies can gain intel on other players' armies, fleets, and cities.
  - When acquired, a spy has a spy level, which provides a bonus to rolls py tasks.
  - Spies can only make one action per turn.
  - **Spy Tasks:**
    - **Establish Spy Ring:** Requires a roll of 15+ on a d20. Success visibility of an army or town until discovered.
    - **Sabotage Supplies:** Requires a roll of 18+ on a d20. Success d s 10% (rounded down) of an army's supplies.
    - **Counterintelligence:** Requires a roll of 15+ on a d20. Success iscover a spy ring in an army or city.
  - **Failure:** If a spy fails a task, they are captured by the player t re acting against. The spy's owner is revealed.
- **Bodyguards**
  - Protects your character from espionage and in battle.

## 4. Town Management

### How it Works

- Players receive a sheet for each town they control.
- You can build up to four buildings in each town.
- These buildings can be upgraded to increase their benefits.

### Population

- Population is a cornerstone mechanic.
- At the start of each season, you gain 1 population point for every 10 you in a town.
- **Population Uses**:
  1.  **Armies:** Recruiting a unit requires paying an amount of populati is population cannot be used for anything else until the unit is disbanded and the population returns to civilian life.
  2.  **Buildings:** Every building must be maintained by a number of pop n equal to its building level (tier). For example, a tier 2 Fields requires two population to operate. The more buildings you build, the m pulation your town needs.

### Town Upgrades

| Upgrading     | Level 2                       | Level 3                       |

## 5. Army Rules

### Overview

Players will need armies to fight wars against other players or outside for

- Armies are broken down into Battalia, which are further broken down into
- Armies can be composed of battalia from multiple players. As long as play ve their troops to the same tile, they can form a single army. This is advantageous due to slower resource and population production.

### Forming an Army

- An army is founded when a player or group of players appoints a character ad a group of Battalia's.
- When this is done, the player(s) receive an army card/slide.

### Supplies and Upkeep

- Each army needs enough supplies _before_ it leaves a town to pay its upke h turn.
- Upkeep is paid in Food and Ducats.
- **Example:** If an army has an upkeep of 200 ducats and 20 food, and it w outside a town for 5 turns, it needs 1000 ducats and 100 food in its supplies before it leaves.
- An army without adequate supplies will suffer desertion.

### Recruitment

- There are 5 unit types as of right now: pikes, matchlocks, flintlocks, li valry, and heavy cavalry. (Note: Artillery and Swordsmen are also listed).
- **Requirements for recruitment**:
  1.  You must have the Muster Field building of a high enough tier. (Not illery School is needed for artillery).
  2.  You must pay the correct population cost.
  3.  You must pay the resource and ducat cost.
- **Example:** To recruit one regular unit of light cavalry, you need 6 pop n, 6 horses, and 200 ducats. This unit is then added to one of your Battalia.

### Recruitment Cost Table

| Unit Type          | Ducat Cost | Resource Cost           | Population Cost |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :-------------- |

## 6. Campaign & Map Rules

### Time

- Time passes in two forms: turns and years.
- Four turns make up one year.

### Construction

- Construction takes an amount of turns equal to the tier level of the buil
- **Example:** A tier one Embassy takes one turn to complete, while a tier Embassy takes three turns.

### Movement

- Armies move a number of tiles per turn based on the terrain.
  - **Roads:** 4 tiles
  - **Open/fields:** 3 tiles
  - **Forests:** 2 tiles
  - **Marshlands/rivers:** 1 tile
- Movement takes place anonymously and at the same time.

### Outside the Map

- There are four roads that lead off the map.
- These are where NPC forces will arrive from.
- Players can also use these roads to explore or expand into neighboring re
- **Note:** Towns taken _outside_ the electorate do not count towards the v rcentage. Players will face heavy resistance from the native NPC regions.

## Appendix: Imperium Fragmentum (2nd Edition Ruleset)

This section contains the complete rules for **Imperium Fragmentum**, which ted as a "refined version" or "2nd edition" of the game. Its rules for income, buildings, units, and combat _may replace_ the rules in the section e.

### Foreword

"I have poured many hours into the original game and many more into this no ned version of it, I really do hope that everyone enjoys it.
A special thanks to people who helped me refine this 2nd edition of the gam
Eli, for help with game balancing
Ben, for help with balancing, map building, and combat testing
Aidan, for taking a long time to make a well done detailed map that also wa nced for spawn locations
And finally to you the player for giving my dream project a chance :)"

### 1. Sequence of the Turn

1.  Collect Income
2.  Pay upkeep and move armies
3.  Receive event
4.  Build, and recruitment
5.  Give movement orders

### 2. Turn Phase Details

#### Collect Income

- Income is based on a formula for a hands-on economy approach.
- **Formulas**:
  - `Local wealth = (Tier level + resources sold) - player tax`
  - `Player wealth = (%tax rate x Local wealth) - imperial tax when appli
- This system involves players building local economies for a better tax br
- **Example:** A city with 90 local wealth gains 20 per turn, totaling 110 . If the tax rate is 10%, the player gains 11 wealth, and the city has 99 wealth left for next turn.
- Players can set taxes in increments of 5. Taxing a city for more than it will eventually leave it with zero wealth.

#### Pay Upkeep and Move Armies

- Army upkeep must be paid at the start of the turn. If not paid in full, t y will mutiny and raid to make up for lost pay.
- Armies move at the same time to avoid conflict. Players reveal their orde move simultaneously.
- **Movement Rates (by Terrain)**:
  - Major Roads = 5 hexes
  - Minor Roads = 4 hexes
  - Open Ground = 3 hexes
  - Forests = 2 hexes

#### Receive Event

- An event available to all players will trigger, providing opportunities f rigue.

#### Building and Recruitment

- Similar to _War of the Elector_, buildings and units have a cost in resou nd money.
- These costs are paid from the player's wealth, not the cities' wealth.
- Citizens pay via their taxes.

#### Give Movement Orders

- At the _end_ of the turn, if a player will move an army _next_ turn, they write it down and give it to the game master before the turn passes. No exceptions.

### 3. Resources & Buildings

The 5 resources are:

- Crops

### 5. Battles

Battles occur when two armies are in the same tile and one side initiates.

#### Battle Setup

1.  Players roll 1d20 to decide deployment.
2.  Whoever deploys first goes second.
3.  Deployment zones are set by the GM.
4.  Players alternate placing one unit until both armies are set up.

#### Order of the Battle Turn

1.  Leadership Phase
2.  Movement Phase
3.  Shooting Phase
4.  Charge Phase
5.  Fight Phase

#### Leadership Phase

- **Reaction Points:** The general's command value gives Reaction Points, r ed at the start of each turn.
- **Morale Checks:** Any unit below half its starting health must take a mo heck.
- The check is 1d20; a 15+ is required to pass.
- **Morale Boosts:** A unit adds its tier's morale value to the roll (e.g., unit gets +4).
- Being within 12" of the general gives +1; 6" gives +2.
- **Failure:** A roll of 1 always fails. A failed check means the unit is r . It is captured if an enemy is within 6", otherwise destroyed.

#### Movement Phase

- Dismounted units move 6".
- Mounted units move 12".
- **Running:** A unit may run by rolling a d6 (2d6 for Cavalry) and adding their movement. A unit that runs cannot shoot or charge that turn.
- **Withdrawing:** Units can withdraw from combat. If they do, all enemy un contact may make one round of attacks on it. The unit can take no more actions after withdrawing. A unit cannot withdraw through other units.
- **Note:** Cavalry can withdraw from combat without being struck back agai
- **Moving into Combat:** Ending movement in base contact with an enemy uni "charge," and they will fight in the fight phase.

#### Shooting Phase

- Done by units with crossbows or bows.
- Bows: 16" range. (Note: A different source says 24")
- Crossbows: 8" range. (Note: A different source says 12")
- Bows can fire over friendly units (arched shots); Crossbows require direc of sight.
- Ranged units get one attack when shooting.
- A unit that shoots cannot charge. A unit cannot shoot if in melee.

#### Charge Phase

- A unit that hasn't run or shot can charge an enemy within range (6" Infan 2" Cavalry).
- Roll 1d6 (2d6 for Cavalry) to see how far the unit moves toward the enemy
- If the unit ends in base contact, the charge is successful, and they figh he fight phase.
- **Flanking Bonuses**:
  - Side Charge: 2+ to # of attacks.
  - Back Charge: 3+ to # of attacks.

#### Fight Phase

- Each unit makes two attacks, plus any bonuses (e.g., from charging).
- Units from _both_ sides attack, not just the active player.
- **Example:** Player A (active) attacks Player B's unit with two of his ow s.
  1.  Player A (Unit 1) attacks.
  2.  Player B (Unit 1) chooses which of Player A's units to attack back.
  3.  Player A (Unit 2) attacks.

#### Hit Rolls (D20 Matchup Table)

- Each unit has a base attack of 4 d20 dice.
- The table shows the d20 roll needed for a successful hit.
- **Example:** A T1 unit needs a 12+ to hit a T2 unit.

| Atk ↓ / Def → | T1  | T2  | T3  | T4  | T5  |
| :------------ | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **T1**        | 9+  | 12+ | 15+ | 18+ | 20+ |
| **T2**        | 7+  | 9+  | 12+ | 15+ | 18+ |
| **T3**        | 5+  | 7+  | 9+  | 12+ | 15+ |
| **T4**        | 3+  | 5+  | 7+  | 9+  | 12+ |
| **T5**        | 2+  | 3+  | 5+  | 7+  | 9+  |

#### Reaction Points

- At the start of _your_ battle turn, you get Reaction Points based on your commander's level.
- These can be spent during an _opponent's_ turn in response to their actions.
- Once spent, they do not refresh until the start of your next turn.
- Points do not save between rounds. A unit can only be targeted by a reaction once per turn.

**Reactions List:**

- **Shield Wall:** Immovable. Negates frontal charge bonus. If spear vs. cavalry, it gets the cavalry's charge bonus _against_ the cavalry. Minus 2 to be hit by ranged.
- **Loose Formation:** 4-, ranged hit chance 4+, melee hit chance.
- **Withdrawal:** A unit retreats one full movement.
- **Turn to face:** A unit turns to face one incoming enemy unit from the direction they are moving.
